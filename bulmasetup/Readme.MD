# What to do to make Bulma personalization works
- First of all, NodeJS+NPM must be installed.
- Then, npm can be used to install the required nodejs packages:
    - npm install node-sass --save-dev
    - npm install bulma --save-dev
- Now, Bulma css file can be built from "npm run build-css" 
- Alternatively, if "npm start" is used, changes to sass/mystyles.scss are monitored and the target css file is updated.
